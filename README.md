# cis7-project
Welcome to the Vigenere Cipher!
This project was made by me, Anthony Gonzalez.
This project will encrypt a message and decrypt it and then it will display the plaintext, the ciphertext, and then show you the encrypted message along with the decrypted one! 
This project was finalized on December 16th 2021,and created with a string approach to behave as the Vigenere Cipher graph.
